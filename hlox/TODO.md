# TODO list

Some notes or ideas about what maybe could be improved.

- clean up naming of runtime types, statements and expressions
- revise formatting (e.g. break long lines)
- sort functions that pattern match on statements and expressions
- check if readability improves at some places by using
  `foo Bar{baz=b}` instead of `foo (Bar _ _ z _ _)`
- add tests
  - or convert and integrate test suite from book
